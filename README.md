**USER STORY 2** <br>
Lizzie recently had her pc broken and is urgently in need of a new one for her working needs. She is also unfortunately on a tight budget and therefore can't spend that much money on a random pc. She also has no prior knowledge on what is useful in a pre-built pc for working pruposes, weather the cpu,gpu or other hardwares are useful when it comes to work related things. Because of this, she looks to the internet in order to find what would suit a working pc the most. She comes across this website. Here she finds a section called 'hardware information' that peeked her interest. Navigating to that section, she finds information on most of the hardwares in a pc and what thier use is. The recommended pc section also showcased pre-built pc's from different brands attuned for both gaming and working. With the information she has aquired from this, she can plan her budget on a pc (By looking at the recommendations) with a suitable price tag which is also configured to working. 
With the help from this website Lizzie was able to find information on the use of all the pc parts condensed and summarised into one page instead of searching what each part is for. Along with that, she was able to get a pc thats fully kitted for work purposes, and with a reasonable price as well.
