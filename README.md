# Name: SG Dropship

## Design Process<br>
A place where you can purchase different games and gaming add ons (Either DLC's or like physical items), 
an online shop with a search bar filter.
A level up system whearas the more items you buy, you will earn points and xp (Depending on the amount you spend)
points can be used to redeem vouchers/ random item from the shop/ chosen item from the shop. Xp is used to level
up your profile. With each level up you can earn special "perks" that can
be used at any time

**User Story**<br>
John wants to buy a new game along with some gaming controllers to play the games with his friends. he finds out about this website and finds the cool features like the tic tac toe and spin the wheel minigames on it, as well as just the area where he can buy his games. So as he creates his own account and logs in, he finds out that there is an entire levelling system where you can earn perks the more "xp" you gain which is aquired through purchasing these items. He can buy the items he wants as well as to gain xp and levels so in the future he can spend them on the website, bringing him back every time.

## Features
The website would feature many useful tools that the user can use in order to navigate their way through the website. <br>

### Existing Features
**\\Navigation bar** <br>
There will be a navigation bar located at the top of the website which would feature:<br>
**Home:** <br>
Made with a custom Icon created by ourselves, this is the logo for SG dropship that will always bring you back to the home page<br>
Kitted with a sign in and log in pop up that is able to work with API data storing<br>

**Browse Products:** <br>
A place where customers can browse the numerous products of games, gaming modifiers and hopefully more with a working purchase system and working search bar<br>

**Profile:** <br>
the hub where customers are able to view their own profile, their level, their exp, the unlockable levels and the perks that are unlocked when they do unlock it, as well as information on how to earn those levels. 2 Mini games are also there for the entertainment factor; spin the wheel and tic tac toe with a working AT opponent!<br>

**Browse Rewards:** <br>
An area where people are able to spend their points on numerous prizes, from gift cards of different stores to an item they get to choose in our own catalogue!<br>


### Features left to implement<br>
Payment options are still not a thing as you would need personal information from buyers.<br>
Spin the wheel still has to fixed usage, so far just a fun activity people can play around with, same as tic tac toe<br>



## Technologies Used <br>
We used the technologies of the core 3: Javascript, Css and HTML. Along with other helpful extensions such as JQuery and Lottie Animations.<br>
javascript<br>
We used Javascript for mostly all the responsive features, from linking the API, to the pop up login and sign up pages, to the numerous activities, games and shopping cart purchasing factors<br>
<br>
HTML<br>
HTML takes up the majority of the code and its the main source of program that contains all the information and content of the pages<br>
<br>
CSS<br>
I used CSS to decorate and beutify my pages with asthetics, pictures and more. Without it, the pages would look bland and some of the content such as the nav bar would not be possible<br>
<br>
JQuery<br>
JQuery was mainly used as the linking paths between the API storing data and the inputs in the sign up/log in forms as well as retreival of data from the API<br>
<br>
Lottie<br>
lottie animations played a decent part in bringing the website to life with movable GIFS that represented either buttons or other symbols<br>
<br>

## Testing
Users are able to sign up and login to our website freely, they will be able to see all products and rewards but will not be able to interact with any of them till they log in. Once doing so, they can freely explore the website and its activities.<br>

**User Story**<br>
index --> Sign up --> Log in --> browse products --> Buy the products --> earn points and xp --> check out profile --> Play activities and learn how to use points


**bugs**<br>
"put" API for product where you replace values of point gain(specifically), xp and level is not able to be added<br>
<br>
Points in rewards page do not update immediately after spending them, rather it takes some time<br>
